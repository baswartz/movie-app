## Overview

This is a mobile app for discovering and searching movies, built with React Native, Expo, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (via NativeWind), and Appwrite. The app features trending movies, search, and a popularity algorithm based on user engagement.

I built this project by following the [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery/videos) tutorial by Adrian Hajdin. Full credit for the original code structure and walkthrough goes to the creators. This repository is my personal adaptation, and I will be adding my own features and UX improvements soon.
